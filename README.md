# Over 1000 feeds for web developers

Download feeds.opml and import it into your feed reader. If youâ€™re not sure which feed reader to use, I recommend the [Feedbro browser extension](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/).

I add new feeds to feeds.opml once per month. Watch this repo to get notified of new releases.

If this repo inspired you to add a feed to your own blog, [read this guide](https://danburzo.ro/add-a-web-feed/).

In addition to the collection in this repo, I maintain a list of blogs without functioning feeds in a [separate spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQA9Av3-Mx2ZU7Ez8_vqZS43J0MiJnipNoei8Tsjc-bs_Dax3k1LX1b8xs0JV_6zSmU9BqnQiObH6pD/pubhtml).
